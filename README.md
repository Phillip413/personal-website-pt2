# personal-website-pt2
In this Project we are building a personal website. The website incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create 3 HTML pages (Home, About, and Portfolio) as well as style them.
As part of part2, we are also creating an additional page called Contact which will contain a form with specific fields (name, email, message, submit button). The website will also be updated with improved layouts using CSS Grid and/or flex as well as have proportional units and dynamic styling (hover effects).
